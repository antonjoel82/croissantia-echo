This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to your own file named `.env.local`.
2. Run `npm install`

Then populate the environment variables from Joel.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

In a separate terminal instance, run `npx novu-labs@latest echo`

Open [http://localhost:2022](http://localhost:2022) with your browser to see the result, and follow Echo instructions.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
